# Predicting Asteroid Diameter

### Project Statement:
> The purpose of this project is to determine a method of predicting the diameter of asteroids.

### Context:
> Asteroids range from a height equivalent to the average human to more than a quarter the size of the moon and orbit in all different areas of the solar system. 
> NASA and other space organizations are interested in their size for modeling the effect of their impact on Earth and other bodies in the solar system. 
> There are also talks about traveling to certain asteroids for mining purposes or (not just for the movies) for altering their trajectory.
